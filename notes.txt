New in this release:

Added feature to toggle serial open/close using the F10 key.

Added feature to switch between UNIX/DOS end of line characters.

Also, there is source included in this release.  I build the program
using the minGW libraries on Linux.  For building on Windows, you have
to look at the makefile and use whatever compiler you have to do the
same functions.  Under Cygwin, the makefile _should_ work.
